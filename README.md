# Portfolio Repositories

## Here you can find all the repos related to my portfolio projects

All projects use python3 with anaconda distribution on Mac OS.
Each project is organized in a separate folder. You can find all the necessary information in the same folder. Since the used datasets are large in volume, I have not incorporated the dataset into the project folder, and provide the references of the same.
I have used below libraries to perform the analysis across all the projects.

- OS
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciKit-Learn
- SciPy
- NLTK
- XgBoost
- Light GBM
- Warnings

For all the analysis, I have used an experimental/research approach using Jupyter notebooks. I have a plan to add OOP based production-ready code once I find some time.

Consistently, I do update this repository as I progress in practising several data science techniques.

Thanks for taking some time to check my repos.
