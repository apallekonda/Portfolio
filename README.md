# Portfolio Repositories

## Here you can find all the repos related to my portfolio projects

All  projects developed in python3 with anaconda distribution on Mac OS.<br>
Each project organized in a separate folder. You can find all the necessary information in the same folder. Since used datasets are large in volume, I have not incorporated data into the project folder, but I have mentioned the references for the same.

I have used below libraries to perform the analysis across all the projects.

- OS
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Scipy
- NLTK
- XgBoost
- Light GBM
- Warnings

For all the analysis, I have used an experimental/research approach using Jupyter notebooks. I  have a plan to add OOP based production-ready code once I get time.

Consistently, I do update this repository as I progress in practising several data science techniques.

Thanks for taking some time to chek my repos.
