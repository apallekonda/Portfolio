## Nuts and Bolts
  * To answer this question I have used mecari provided dataset. <br>
  "Mercari is the selling app. We make it super easy to sell (or buy) almost anything. We all have things we donâ€™t use, never used or simply outgrew. But that stuff still has value. Mercari gives you the power to simply sell it, ship it, and earn some cash for it. Fashion to toys. Sporting goods to electronics. All the brands you know and love".
